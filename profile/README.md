[tsg](https://paradigm.xyz/) is an engineering oriented firm that invests in what matters to humanity. Our approach is flexible, long term, multi-stage, and global.
We often get involved at the earliest stages of formation and continue supporting our portfolio companies over time.

We take a deeply hands-on approach to help projects reach their full potential, from the technical (mechanism design, security, engineering) 
to the operational (recruiting, regulatory strategy).

This Github Organization hosts all of Paradigm's open source experiments, designs, and production-ready code.

We have three divisions:
* [tsg.capital](https://github.com/paradigmxyz/reth)
* [tsg.trading](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry/)
* [tsg.labs](https://github.com/alloy-rs/)
  
You can find our [research at the Paradigm website](https://www.paradigm.xyz/writing).
